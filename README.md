# pyweek17
PyWeek 2017 project

The theme is **"The Lesser of Two Evils"**!

## Ideas

 * An action/strategy game featuring a multiobjective optimization problem.
 * User controls a radiation beam to shoot against evil cells.
 * Evil cell clusters conform tumours.
 * Healthy cell clusters conform organs.
 * The objective is to destroy all evil cells while causing the least possible damage to healthy cells.
 * Different cells have different radiation resistance.
 * Evil cells can probabilistically infect adjacent cells.
 * Probabilities depends on cell type.
 * Damaged healthy cells can **mutate** and become evil.
 * Too much healthy cells dead in the same organ means host organism damage.
 * Possibility of using different beam types (photons, protons).
 * Dose-Volume histograms for calculating user records.

## User interface

 * Touch for fixing first point, release for fixing second point, both points define shooting vector
